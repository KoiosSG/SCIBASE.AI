# Acceptance Notes

- Adds `enterprise-dashboard-accessibility-guard/` as an independent module.
- Keeps all records synthetic and local.
- Uses dependency-free Node.js logic for deterministic dashboard release decisions.
- Covers blocked, clean, and warning-only dashboard states with tests.
- Treats noncritical low-contrast content as a remediation warning before public release.
- Blocks release when critical dashboard contrast evidence is missing, invalid, or still expressed as unresolved CSS color tokens.
- Treats missing noncritical dashboard contrast evidence as a remediation warning before public release.
- Blocks release when keyboard-reachable dashboard controls suppress visible focus indicators.
- Blocks malformed dashboard component evidence before it can crash release assessment.
- Blocks malformed top-level dashboard packets before they can crash release assessment.
- Blocks malformed reduced-motion evidence before it can crash animated chart assessment.
- Blocks release when private data appears in table or export accessibility summaries.
- Generates reviewer artifacts:
  - `reports/blocked-packet.json`
  - `reports/missing-contrast-packet.json`
  - `reports/missing-noncritical-contrast-packet.json`
  - `reports/malformed-component-packet.json`
  - `reports/malformed-dashboard-packet.json`
  - `reports/malformed-motion-packet.json`
  - `reports/clean-packet.json`
  - `reports/warning-packet.json`
  - `reports/accessibility-report.md`
  - `reports/summary.svg`
  - `reports/demo.mp4`
