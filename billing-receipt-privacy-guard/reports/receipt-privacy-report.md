## Sparse Billing Batch Guard

Empty or partially populated provider batches that omit receipt or line-item collections produce deterministic empty review evidence instead of runtime failures. The empty batch fixture reviewed 0 receipts and generated 0 remediation actions.

## Malformed Billing Field Guard

Receipts with non-numeric totals, quantities, or line-item amounts are held before delivery. The malformed fixture decision is hold-for-finance-review, and customer-facing numeric fields are redacted to null.

## Malformed Line Item Guard

Malformed line-item entries are held before delivery instead of crashing receipt review. The malformed line-item fixture decision is hold-for-finance-review, and the customer-facing line item id is line-malformed-1.

## Safety

All fixtures are synthetic. The guard does not call payment processors, customer systems, private workspaces, institutional finance tools, or external APIs.
