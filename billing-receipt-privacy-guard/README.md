# Billing Receipt Privacy Guard

This module adds a focused Revenue Infrastructure slice for SCIBASE issue #20. It validates customer-facing invoices, receipts, and payment-provider metadata before billing artifacts leave SCIBASE.

The guard detects private research project context, restricted dataset references, collaborator identifiers, grant-sensitive phrases, unsafe receipt identifiers, unsafe customer-facing envelope fields, malformed monetary or quantity fields, malformed top-level billing batches, malformed line-item entries, unsafe line-item fields, and unsafe provider metadata, including nested provider metadata values and provider metadata key names. Missing receipt lists, line-item lists, and provider metadata are treated as empty billing evidence rather than crashing receipt review. Safe receipts remain deliverable, while unsafe receipts are held for finance review with redacted replacement identifiers, safe currency labels, replacement line items, metadata-key redaction handles, and deterministic audit evidence.

## Run

```bash
npm test
npm run demo

npm run check
```
